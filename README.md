# Folder Speed Test

`Folder Speed Test` is a simple PySide6-based GUI tool to benchmark the read and write speeds of a selected folder on your system. It simulates the behavior of tools like CrystalDiskMark but allows users to select any folder for testing, making it convenient for checking specific directories.

This tool performs the following tests:

- Single file speed tests for 1MB, 100MB, and 1GB files.
- Multiple small file tests for 10Ã—1MB, 20Ã—1MB, 100Ã—1MB, and 1000Ã—1MB files.
- Displays both read and write speeds in MB/s.
- Uses a progress bar (with a maximum value set at 1GB/s) to display speed graphically.
- Automatically cleans up test files after each test is completed.

---

## Features

- **Folder Selection**: Choose any folder on your system to perform the speed tests.
- **Custom File Sizes**: Tests the speed of both small and large files (1MB to 1GB).
- **Multiple File Testing**: Tests for large numbers of small files, ideal for stress testing.
- **Free Space Check**: Ensures the selected folder has enough free space before starting the test.
- **Auto Cleanup**: All test files are deleted after the speed tests are completed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI with real-time progress updates.

## Installation

To use `Folder Speed Test`, you need to have **Python 3.8+** installed, along with the required dependencies such as `PySide6` and `psutil`.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/folder-speed-test.git
cd folder-speed-test
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

Creating a virtual environment is highly recommended to keep your dependencies isolated:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the `requirements.txt` file is not created, you can manually install the required packages:

```bash
pip install PySide6 psutil
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using:

```bash
python folder_speed_test.py
```

## Usage

Once the program is running, follow these steps to test the speed of a folder:

1. **Select Folder**: Use the "Browse" button to open a folder dialog, and choose the folder where you want to test the speed.
2. **Start Test**: Click the "Start Test" button to run the write/read speed tests.
3. **Progress Display**: The tool will display the write and read speeds in real-time for various file sizes, using progress bars and speed labels.
4. **Results**: After the tests are completed, all test files will be automatically removed from the folder.

### Test Cases

- **Single File Tests**: The application will perform tests for:
  - 1MB file
  - 100MB file
  - 1GB file

- **Multiple File Tests**:
  - 10Ã—1MB files
  - 20Ã—1MB files
  - 100Ã—1MB files
  - 1000Ã—1MB files

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by CrystalDiskMark.
- Built using the PySide6 library for the GUI.
- Thanks to [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) for the disk space utilities.

### Additional Notes

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: This tool works on Linux and Windows (since it's based on Python), but make sure the folder you test has appropriate permissions.
- **Performance**: The tool is not designed for super-fast enterprise storage but can give a good estimate of read/write performance for typical folders and drives.
